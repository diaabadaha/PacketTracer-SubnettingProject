## Project Description
This project required designing and simulating a detailed network using Packet Tracer. It involved subnetting based on student IDs, configuring devices, implementing OSPF routing across multiple areas, and ensuring network functionality through systematic testing. The styles for the custom `index.html` webpage are contained within the HTML file, showcasing inline CSS for page layout and design. The accompanying technical report includes figures, tables, and comprehensive analysis, verifying the operational success of the simulated network.
